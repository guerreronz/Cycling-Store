# About dataset

## Context

This project was based on how to connect jupyter notebooks/python with an existing database to be able to use SQL stataments. The dataset was retrieved from a sample
database called Bike Stores, since the database has several tables, I had to use a join statement to select the tables and columns I was interested on.

## Content

The dataset includes information on sales, customer and data that could be found in retail stores. Also includes data about product, orders and prices.

The dataset comprises:

order_id: order id of the purchase

order_date: date of the purchase

customer_id: code to id each customer

state: state in which the purchase was made

zip_code: zip code of the purchase

quantity: how many items include the purchase

list_price: the list price of the item

produt_id: id of the product

product_name: name of the product

brand_id: brand id of the product

brand_name: name of the brand

staff_id: id of the staff who helped on the purchase
